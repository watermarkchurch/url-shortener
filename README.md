# Watermark URL shortener

This is the simplest possible URL shortener.  It uses [Netlify Redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/)
to accomplish the URL shortening.  Adding a new redirect is as simple as adding a new line to the [`_redirects` file](./public/_redirects) and committing the change.
